    "\n",
    "The [**image-classification**](image-classification/01-image-classification.ipynb) demo demonstrates an end-to-end solution for image recognition: the application uses TensorFlow, Keras, Horovod, and Nuclio to build and train an ML model that identifies (recognizes) and classifies images. \n",
    "The application consists of four MLRun and Nuclio functions for performing the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import an image archive from from an Amazon Simple Storage (S3) bucket to the platform's data store.\n",
    "2. Tag the images based on their name structure.\n",
    "3. Train the image-classification ML model by using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/); use [Horovod](https://eng.uber.com/horovod/) to perform distributed training over either GPUs or CPUs.\n",
    "4. Automatically deploy a Nuclio model-serving function from [Jupyter Notebook](nuclio-serving-tf-images.ipynb) or from a [Dockerfile](./inference-docker).\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo also provides an example of an [automated pipeline](image-classification/02-create_pipeline.ipynb) using [MLRun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) and [Kubeflow pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines)."

    "The goal is to identify anomalies for device metrics &mdash; such as CPU, memory consumption, or temperature &mdash; which can signify an upcoming issue or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model training is sped up by using the [Dask](https://dask.org/) Python library for parallel computing, which extends [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames.\n",
    "- The model prediction is done by using open-source Python libraries &mdash; including [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) (a.k.a. sklearn), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/), and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) &mdash; and the gradient boosting ML technique.\n",
    "- The data is generated by using an open-source generator tool that was written by Iguazio.\n",
    "  This generator enables users to customize the metrics, data range, and many other parameters, and prepare a data set that's suitable for other similar use cases."
